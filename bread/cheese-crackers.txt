1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp white ground pepper (optional)
4 Tbs cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
8 ounces grated cheddar cheese
3-4 Tbs water

Pulse the flour, salt and pepper, then add butter and pulse until the mixture
resembles coarse meal. Add grated cheese a little at a time until the mixture
again resembles coarse meal.

Pulse in 3 to 4 tablespoons of water, one tablespoon at a time, and only enough
so that the dough forms a ball and rides the blade.

Remove, wrap in plastic, and chill for 20 minutes or up to 24 hours.

Roll the dough out to 1/8th-inch thickness directly onto a baking sheet.  Using
a knife or pizza cutter, cut 1 inch squares, then bake at 350Â° F for 15-20
minutes or until crackers are golden brown. If the outer edges your pan are
done but the crackers in the center still need a few more minutes- remove
crackers on the edges and bake the center crackers for a few more minutes.
