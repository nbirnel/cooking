Adapted from Lord Krishna's Cuisine

30 ml warm water
1 pkg dry yeast
1 tsp sugar
let foam

90 ml warm milk (upped from recipe's 60ml)
60 ml yogurt
60 ml melted butter 
blend in to yeast

355 g flour
  37 g ww (10%)
7 g salt (2%)
10 g poppy seeds (2.5%)
3 g baking powder (1%) ?! what for?

Very stiff dough, difficult to bring together.

10×5 inch teardrops, baked at 550°F 4-5 minutes. About 6 naan.

Try increasing liquid, and perhaps increase recipe by 33% for 8 naan. (The 
three of us ate 4, and had 2 left which were inadequate for lunch leftovers).
