This is cakey. Banana was a mistake. Maybe more ginger.

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Mix:
  2 c (260 g) ap flour
  1 tsp (5 g) baking soda
  ¼ tsp salt
  1½ tsp cinnamon
  1 tsp ground ginger
  ⅛ tsp cloves

Cream:
  ½ c butter
  ½ c light brown sugar

Beat in, one by one:
  2 large eggs (80 g) - or I used 100 g mashed banana, which was too banana-ey.

Beat in:
  ½ c (120 ml) unsulphured molasses
  lemon zest or other flavoring

Beat in, in 3 additions:
  the dry ingredients
  1 c (240 ml) milk

Bake in a 9" cake pan, greased and floured, for 40 - 45 minutes, until
knife-clean.
Rest 10 minutes.
