2% Salinity:  Carrot sticks, shreds, slices; broccoli, cauliflower, pearl
onions, green beans (add grape leaves to preserve color), asparagus,
green/red peppers de-seeded, parsnip, kohlrabi, Jerusalem artichoke,
zucchini (whole), sliced radish, whole-small radish, whole green tomato,
are but a few examples. Quick guide: Fill the Pickl-It with food (dice,
chunk, whole, etc.) to 1-inch below the "shoulder".  Add 2% brine to the
"shoulder" so your vegetables are covered with 1-inch of brine.

For kraut, use 22 grams of salt for every 5-pounds of shredded cabbage.
Our consulting microbiologists provided us with this tested ratio which
results in a 2% brine.  Alternate layers of cabbage/salt and press every
2-3 inches using a wooden tool. The goal is to press out oxygen-pockets,
not to mash the cabbage.    Continue building layers until the cabbage
is compacted, 1-inch below the shoulder of the jar.  For more details,
see the kraut recipe.

3.5% Salinity: Pickled cukes for pickling-varieties such as Kirby
or Boston.  Fermented short-term (7-days on-counter, then 2 weeks in
fridge) creates "half-sour" - still half-white, somewhat green inside.
More fermentation-time creates evenly-distributed green color and sublime
flavor. See: "Are My Pickled-Cukes Done?"

10% Salinity:  For those serious about brine-curing meat, crafting
authentic feta-cheese, pepper-mashes, curing green olives, authentic
fish-sauce, and shrimp-sauce.
