Buns

 170 to 227g lukewarm water
 28g butter
 1 large egg 
 418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
 50g sugar
 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 
 1 tablespoon instant yeast 

 *For best results (a smooth, slightly soft dough), use the
 smaller amount of water in summer (or in a humid environment),
 the greater amount in winter (or in a dry climate); and something
 in between the rest of the time.

Topping

 43g melted butter

1) Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients by hand, mixer, or
bread machine to make a soft, smooth dough.

2) Cover the dough, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, or until it's
nearly doubled in bulk.

3) Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into 8 pieces. Shape
each piece into a round ball; flatten to about 3" across. Place the
buns on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, cover,
and let rise for about an hour, until noticeably puffy.

4) Brush the buns with about half of the melted butter.

5) Bake the buns in a preheated 375Â°F oven for 15 to 18 minutes,
until golden. Remove them from the oven, and brush with the remaining
melted butter. This will give the buns a satiny, buttery crust.

6) Cool the buns on a rack.

Yield: 8 large buns.

For slightly smaller buns, divide the dough into 12 pieces instead
of 8. Bake the buns for 12 to 15 minutes, instead of 15 to 18
minutes. And how about "slider buns" about 3" in diameter? Divide
the dough into 24 pieces, and bake for 12 to 15 minutes.

quite stiff dough. High proportion of ww means need more water?
Did not rise so mightily as before; had to do as 8 buns, 16 min.
