From Marcella Hazan,
but weighed flour. 
She calls for 1.5c flour to 1 egg,
nothing else.
With 2 eggs, this came to 225g flour,
but I skimped to 220g.
I might reduce to 100g / egg.
Very difficult to bind together (required kneading, not mixing),
and difficult to roll out - I gave up and used pasta machine.
Able to roll to #7 on machine.
Rolled on #7 2×,
rested ~30m, 
cut to 1cm.
Nice texture, cooked very fast (~mins and was a little too sticky.)
Erin and Audrey liked very well.
2 eggs + 220g flour was almost 2× too much for the three of us 
with 2 big artichokes, a sausage, and 3 mushroomss.

Just discovered I misread Hazan. She calls for .75c flour per egg.
Trying 225g semolina to 2 eggs. Again needed kneading.
