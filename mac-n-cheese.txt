for the big white pan:

béchamel:
  2 Tbs flour
  2 Tbs butter
  2 c milk
  salt
  pepper
  nutmeg
  2 eggs

Partially cook
  450 g macaroni
Drain, pour into buttered baking pan, add
  olive oil
and
  87 g gouda
  158 g dubliner 
  72 g jack
  74 g parmesan
  -------
  391 g total cheese

Pour on béchamel,
cover with foil,
bake at 350°F for 20 minutes,
remove foil and brown under broiler.

Try putting the parmesan mostly on top,
cooking without foil, 
and reducing cheese (especially jack and gouda).

same as above, but
  1½ c béchamel
with
  1 egg
  1 egg white
and
  85 g swiss
  160 g tillamook cheddar
  40 g parmesan
  -------
  260 g total cheese
and top with
  40 g parmesan
Cover for 10 minutes, uncover for 15 minutes.
For the glass pan, and a party.

This was a better texture and crust, but not tangy enough.
Try less swiss, more cheddar.
